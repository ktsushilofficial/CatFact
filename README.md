# CatFact
Technical Aspects of the Cat Facts & Images App
1. Programming Language:

Swift: The app is developed using Swift, a powerful and intuitive programming language for iOS app development.
2. Architectural Pattern:

MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel): The app follows the MVVM architectural pattern to ensure a clear separation of concerns, promoting better organization and maintainability of the codebase.
3. Networking:

URLSession: Networking is handled using URLSession, which is used to make API calls to retrieve cat images and facts from external services.
API Endpoints:
Cat Image: https://api.thecatapi.com/v1/images/search retrieves random cat images.
Cat Fact: https://meowfacts.herokuapp.com/?lang=eng retrieves random cat facts.
4. JSON Parsing:

Decodable Protocol: The app utilizes Swift's Decodable protocol to parse JSON responses from the APIs into model objects, ensuring type safety and ease of use.
5. Data Models:

CatImage Model: A struct that represents the structure of cat image data, including properties such as id, url, width, and height.
CatFact Model: A struct that represents the structure of cat fact data, containing properties for the fact text.
6. User Interface:

UIKit: The user interface is built using UIKit components, providing a responsive and interactive layout that displays cat images and facts.
7. State Management:

ViewModel: The ViewModel manages the state of the app by fetching data from the service layer and exposing it to the view for rendering.
8. Unit Testing:

XCTest Framework: The app includes unit tests written using the XCTest framework to validate both the functionality of the ViewModel and the network layer. Tests include both positive and negative scenarios to ensure reliability.
9. Dependency Management:

CocoaPods or Swift Package Manager (SPM): Third-party frameworks can be managed using CocoaPods or SPM to simplify integration and dependency management (if applicable).
10. Error Handling:

The app includes error handling mechanisms to gracefully manage potential issues during API calls, ensuring that users are informed of any connectivity or data retrieval problems.
These technical aspects form the foundation of the Cat Facts & Images app, ensuring it is robust, maintainable, and enjoyable for users.
